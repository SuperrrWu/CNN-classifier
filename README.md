# CNN-classifier
This is a model trained by neural networks to predict which fruit a single image identifies.

You should change the filepath into right path.

The trained neural network may not be accurate in recognizing new images. This is because the training set is finite. If you want to improve the accuracy, add pictures to the folder and change the batch number.

The first part of this program is to change the name of the folder, change the size of the image, and change the array matrix to (number, width, height, number of channels)

After that is a game, enter the path of the fruit picture you want to recognize. Show the picture first, then you can tell what kind of fruit it is, and then decide if it is correct.
